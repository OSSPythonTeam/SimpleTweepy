Installation
============

The easiest way to install the latest version from PyPI is by using pip::

    pip install tweepy

To use the ``tweepy.asynchronous`` subpackage, be sure to install with the
``async`` extra::

    pip install tweepy[async]

You can also use Git to clone the repository from GitHub to install the latest
development version::

    git clone https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git
    cd tweepy
    pip install .

Alternatively, install directly from the GitHub repository::

    pip install git+https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git
